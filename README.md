I have done analysis on Australia road accident data using three different Algorithms with Scikit-learn

#Tools used
There are three folders each folder has analysis files.
These analysis are done with three different Algorithms using scikit learn.
The Algorithms used are Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine.

#How to use
There are thre files in easch folder:
ausaccident.csv is the original file that show the data of accidents in Austrlia.
ausaccident.csv is converted into numeric data for analysis purpose "workvoltaa.csv" is the numeric file on which the analysis is done.
And then we have ".ipvnb" file which is the jupyter notebook file.
